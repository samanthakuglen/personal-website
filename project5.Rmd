### A. Overview 
```{r setup, include=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

```

This code analyzes data from the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the historic Willamette Falls Locks, located on the west bank of the Willamette River in West Linn, Oregon. Here, we focus on salmonids and their adult fish passage. 3 tabs are used to visually explore the data with through a time series, seasonplots, and annual counts by species, respectively. This data is important because can help inform regulations for the State of Oregon policy to "provide for the upstream and downstream passage for native migratory fish."

```{r}
# Read in the data 
salmon_data <- read_csv(here("data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv")) %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  select("date", "coho", "jack_coho", "steelhead") %>% 
  mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  group_by(date, coho, jack_coho, steelhead) %>%

```

### Tab 1: Original Time Series

```{r}
# Filter for each species (Coho, Jack Coho, Steelhead) to be on separate panels 
coho_panel <- salmon_ts_long %>% 
  filter(species == "coho")

jack_coho_panel <- salmon_ts_long %>% 
  filter(species == "jack_coho")

steelhead_panel <- salmon_ts_long %>% 
  filter(species == "steelhead")

# Create plots for each
coho_plot <- ggplot(coho_panel, aes(x = date, y = count))+
  geom_line(aes(color =  "#1aa5b8")) +
  theme_linedraw()+
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Coho") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
jack_plot <- ggplot(jack_coho_panel, aes(x = date, y = count))+
  geom_line(aes(color =  "#1aa5b8")) +
  theme_linedraw()+
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Jack Coho") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

steelhead_plot <- ggplot(steelhead_panel, aes(x = date, y = count))+
  geom_line(aes(color =  "#1aa5b8")) +
  theme_linedraw()+
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Steelhead") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
  
# Combine plots using `patchwork` package
tab_1_plots <- coho_plot / jack_plot / steelhead_plot

tab_1_plots + 
  plot_annotation(title = "Time Series of Adult Fish Passage at Willamette Fish Ladder") 

```

**Figure 1.**  Time series of counts by species of coho, jack coho, and steelhead salmonids on the Willamette fish ladder from 2001 to 2010. Note: different y-axis scales between species. Data: Columbia River DART.

### Tab 2: Seasonplots
```{r}
# Create season plot 
salmon_ts_long %>% 
  mutate(species = case_when(
    species == "coho" ~ "Coho",
    species == "jack_coho" ~ "Jack Coho", 
    species == "steelhead" ~ "Steelhead")) %>% 
  gg_season(y = count, year.labels = TRUE, continuous = TRUE) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Fish Count") +
  labs(title = "Seasonplots of Adult Fish Passage Counts by Species", 
       subtitle = "(2001 - 2010)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

### Tab 3: Annual counts by species 

```{r}
salmon_annual <- salmon_ts_long %>% 
  index_by(year = ~year(.)) %>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(salmon_annual_count = sum(count)) %>% 
  mutate(species = case_when( # update for axis labels
    species == "coho" ~ "Coho",
    species == "jack_coho" ~ "Jack Coho", 
    species == "steelhead" ~ "Steelhead")) 

# Create annual count plot
ggplot(salmon_annual, aes(x = year, y = salmon_annual_count)) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  geom_line(aes(color=species)) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = "Annual Total Counts of Adult Fish Passage by Species",
       subtitle = "(2000 - 2010)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Count of adult fish passage",
       color = "Species") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
